This was the most famous \"failed experiment\" in the history of physics in that it did not detect what it was looking forâsomething we now know not to exist at all.  The general idea was to measure the speed of light under different orientations of the equipment relative to the direction of movement of the earth, since relative movement of the ether medium would add or subtract from the speed of the wave.  Yes, it does not work that way under the theory of relativity, but it was a reasonable guess 150 years ago."

Less edit-specific fuzzy matching techniques utilize a \"bag of n-grams\" approach, and include q-gram, cosine distance, and Jaccard distance. Some heuristic metrics like Jaro and Jaro-Winkler are also included in `stringdist` along with the other measures mentioned.
