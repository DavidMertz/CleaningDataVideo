While the organization of this spreadsheet is much like a great many you will encounter \"in the wild,\" it is very little like the tidy data we would rather work with.  In the simple example, only 63 data values occur, and you could probably enter them into the desired structure by hand as quickly as coding the transformations.  However, the point of this exercise is to write programming code that could generalize to larger data sets of similar structure."

    "In thinking about a good data frame organization, think of what the independent and dependent variables are.  In each year, each association awards for each category. These are independent dimensions.  A person name and a film name are slightly tricky since they are not exactly independent, but at the same time some awards are to a film and others to a person.  Moreover, one actor might appear in multiple films in a year (not in this sample data; but do not rule it out).  Likewise, at times multiple films have used the same name at times in film history. Some persons are both director and actor (in either the same or different films)."
