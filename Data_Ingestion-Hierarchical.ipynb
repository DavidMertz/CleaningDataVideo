    "When we utilize machine learning models, and indeed when we perform general statistical analyses, we almost always assume data is tabular. Observations and features; rows and columns.  And yet, there are a number of very popular ways of storing data that resemble trees rather than plowed fields.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many domains that simply map more naturally to hierarchies than to tables.  Yes, the relational algebra—the conceptual structure that underpins SQL and relational databases—is in some way able to represent every possible structure.  But it feels awkward for naturally hierarchical data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, file systems have nested paths that eventually lead to actual files at their leaves.  Directories along the way might have indefinitely many subdirectories, with names at every level expressing something meaningful, until we get to the files which may themselves have hierarchical, tabular, or other arrangements of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, if we make a graph of connected web pages—or indeed of *any* kind of network, whether social connections, electronic communications, ecological interactions, or others—it is closer to a hierarchy than to a table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, not all, nor most, graphs are DAGs (directed acyclical graphs), but still less are they rows and colums.  Or imagine you had a \"book of life\" that described many biological organisms, organized by Linnaean taxonomy—domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species (and perhaps sometimes subspecies, superfamily, subfamily, or tribe for example).  Not only is this hierarchial structure important data, but the leaf attributes are largely different for varying species.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Information on the dentation of prokaryotes is not going to be relevant.  Teeth are only attributes of organisms within the Chordata phylum, and mostly only within the subphylum Vertebrata. Correspondingly, attributes about hyphae are only relevant within the Fungi, Oomycota, or Actinobacteria (crossing domains, kingdoms, and phyla, but still only within a small fragment of the hierarchy). \n",
    "\n",
    "For better or worse, when we do data science with hierarchical data sources, that generally means that we construct a tabular abstraction of the underlying data. Depending on our purpose, either or both of the leaf attributes and branching structure might be relevant.  In either case, we want to encode those as columns of variables and rows of records.  This contrasts somewhat with many purposes outside of data science; for other purposes, it is often simply a matter of \"drilling down\" into the relevant leaf or distant branch, and simply presenting or modifying the small amount of information at that level.  Data science is much more often about generalizing over many different data points, concerning many different objects."

Within that, it can indicate what keys might occur inside objects, which are required, the cardinality of arrays, and a number of other elements, including recursive structures.  An approach of \"validate, then process\" is often useful; here validation merely describes the *structure* of a JSON document, it is not intended to make any claims about it containing *good data*, such as is discussed in chapter 4 (*Anomaly Detection*) and chapter 5 (*Data Quality*).\n",

Other variations of key/value stores are primarily on-disk formats, but they might in turn reside primarily in cache memory, hence achieving similar speed.\n",

    "**Redis** (Remote Dictionary Server) and **Memcached** are popular in-memory systems (with persistence mechanisms on the side).  Memcached, as its name suggests, is most commonly used as a cache, and is hence much less commonly a \"source of knowledge.\"  That is, a cache frequently sits between a client and a server and simply records the previous result from a client.  If an identical request occurs again (possibly limited to some \"staleness\" period) then the complex database query, or difficult computation, or access to additional resources external to the server, can be skipped and the cached result is returned instead.  Redis is sometimes used this way, but is also often used as a definitive or sole source of knowledge for some element of the data needed by a server."

All of these simply map byte strings to other byte strings, without addressing more complex data structures.  In contrast, for example, Redis allows for values to have a rich collection of data types, including collections allowing nesting.  In practice, however, bytes are sufficient to hold any kind of data; it is just a matter of those bytes representing some serialization format, such as JSON texts, or Python pickles (the Python `shelve` module, for example, is basically just DBM coupled with pickles).\n",

Obviously, the manner of use is different between relational and key/value stores, but the same information can easily be represented in either, and both provide their own kind of querying and updating interfaces.\n",

They will not always utilize an ad hoc hierarchy, but doing so is frequent.  Even if there are millions of keys rather than the hundreds in my example, that initial approach can at least assure that consistent path components exist using consistent delimiters (or other formatting of keys)."
