    "A keynote speaker I listened to at a data science conference a few years ago made a joke—perhaps one already widely repeated by the time he told it—about talking with a colleague of his.  The colleague complained of data cleaning taking up half of her time, in response to which the speaker expressed astonishment that it could be so little as 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without worrying too much about assigning a precise percentage, in my experience working as a technologist and data scientist, I have found that the bulk of what I do is preparing my data for the statistical analyses, machine learning models, or nuanced visualizations that I would like to utilize it for.  Although hopeful executives, or technical managers a bit removed from the daily work, tend to have an eternal optimism that the next set of data the organization acquires will be clean and easy to work with, I have yet to find that to be true in my concrete experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, some data is better and some is worse.  But *all data is dirty*, at least within a very small margin of error in the tally.  Even data sets that have been published, carefully studied, and that are widely distributed as canonical examples for statistics textbooks or software libraries, generally have a moderate number of data integrity problems.  Even after our best pre-processing, a more attainable goal should be to make our data *less dirty*; making it *clean* remains unduly utopian in aspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "By all means we should distinguish *data quality* from *data utility*.  These descriptions are roughly orthogonal to each other.  Data can be dirty (up to a point) but still be enormously useful.  Data can be (relatively) clean but have little purpose, or at least not be fit for purpose.  Concerns about the choice of measurements to collect, or about possible selection bias, or other methodological or scientific questions are mostly outside the scope of this book.  However, a fair number of techniques I present can *aid* in evaluating the utility of data, but there is often no mechanical method of remedying systemic issues.  For example, statistics and other analyses may reveal—or at least strongly suggest—the unreliability of a certain data field.  But the techniques in this book cannot generally automatically fix that unreliable data or collect better data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code shown throughout this book is freely available.  However, the purpose of this book is not learning to use the particular tools used for illustration, but to understand the underlying purpose of data quality.  The concepts presented should be applicable in any programming language used for data processing and machine learning.  I hope it will be easy to adapt the techniques I show to your own favorite collection of tools and programming languages."

Exactly where the bytes that make up the data go wrong can vary enormously, and usually does not follow a pattern that lends itself to a single high-level description.

The recorded age of -1 makes no sense in the nature of \"age\" as a data field, at least as we usually understand it (but maybe the encoding intends something different).  On the other hand, -1 is one of several placeholder values used very commonly to represent missing data.  We need to know our specific problem to know whether we can process the data with a missing age, but many times we can handle that.  However, we still need to be careful not to treat the -1 as a plain value; for example, the mean, minimum, or standard deviation of ages might be thrown off by that.\n",

    "Olivia Gupta starts to present a trickier problem.  Structurally her row looks perfect.  But '9' is probably not a string in our lexicon of color names.  And under our understanding of the data concerning a 6th grade class, we don't expect 102 year old students to be in it.  To solve this row, we really need to know more about the collection procedure and the intention of the data.  Perhaps a separate mapping of numbers to colors exists somewhere.  Perhaps an age of 12 was mistranscribed as 102; but also perhaps a 102 year old serves as a teaching assistant in this class and not only students are recorded.\n",

Somehow, persumably, a mechanical error resulted in the line being formatted wrongly.  However, most high-level tools are likely to choke on the row in an uninformative way, and we will probably need to remediate the issue more manually.\n",

The choice among near synonyms is also guided by the predominant use within the particular tool, library, or programming community that is currently being discussed.\n",

    "In many cases, a general concept has a strong overlap with the particular name a tool or library uses to implement or express that concept.  Where relevant, I attempt to use the small typographic distinctions in the names to indicate focus.  For example, I discuss *data frames* as a general paradigm for manipulating data, but refer to *DataFrame* when discussing Pandas or other libraries that use that spelling for the specific class used.  Likewise, R's *data.frame* object is a specific implementation of the paradigm, and capitalization and punctuation will be adjusted for context.  Similarly, in generically discussing a collection of associated data, I describe that as a *data set*; but when discussing the specific array-like object in HDF5, I use the spelling *dataset*."

    "For transformations that you wish to persist longer than the run of a single program, use of version control systems (VCS) is highly desirable.  Most VCSs allow a concept of a *branch* where different versions of files can be maintained in parallel.  If available, use of this capability is often desirable.  Even if your data set versions are strictly linear, it is possible to revert to a particular earlier version if necessary.  Using accurate and descriptive commit messages is a great benefit to data versioning."

    "Most VCSs are intelligent about storing as few bytes as possible to describe changes.  It is often possible for them to calculate a \"minimal change set\" to describe a transformation rather than simply storing an entirely new near-copy for each version.  Whether or not your VCS does this with the formats you work with, data integrity and data provenance should be a more prominent concern than the potential need to allocate more disk space.  Of late, Git is the most popular VCS; but the advice here can equally be followed using Apache Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce, Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, IBM Rational ClearCase, or any other modern VCS. Indeed, an older system like Concurrent Versions System (CVS) suffices for this purpose."

    "None of the exercises throughout this book depend on using any specific programming language.  In the discussion, Python is used most frequently, followed by R, with occaional use of other programming languages.  But all exercises simply present one or more data sets and ask you to perform some task with that.  Achieving those goals using the programming language of your choice is wonderful (subject to any constraints your instructor may provide if this book is used in formal pedagogy).\n",

    "Using the small test data set is a good way to test your code.  But try also manually adding more rows with similar, or different, problems in them, and see how well your code produces a reasonable result.  We have not discussed tools to accomplish this exercise yet, although you likely have used a programming language capable of solving it.  Try to solve it now, but you can come back to this after later chapters if you prefer."
